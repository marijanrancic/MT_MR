 This repositorium represents hub with R code written for my research on the role of fundamental variables in forecasting electricity spot prices and trading strategies between SEEPEX and HUPX markets.
There will be more R files uploaded until the end of December 2020. 
In January 2021, Iâ€™m planning to upload second repository with entso-e automatic download system and more robust forecasting models based on GBM.
